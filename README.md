# Polyglot Bot
Polyglot Bot is a Google Chrome extension built with Javascript, HTML and CSS, utilizing google cloud services such as translate and text to speech. First, we use chrome storage to store settings and then add listeners to the page so whenever words are selected, it’ll use ajax to post data to google cloud services. After receiving the final mp3 encoded content, it’ll be played on the page.
# How to install 
Clone the repository to your local computer. Go to chrome://extensions [chrome extensions](chrome://extensions), turn on **Developer mode**, click **LOAD UNPACKED** button and select the **extension** directory. Then you should have the extension in your chrome browser.
# How to use
Double click on any English word in your window to hear its translation in the language of your choosing. You can also turn on or off by clicking the Polyglot Bot's icon and open the control panel.
